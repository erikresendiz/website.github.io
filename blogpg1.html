    Hi I'm Erik Resendiz, I'm trying to learn Web design.
    I want to learn it because it's pretty fun so far.
    So far I know a bit of javascript this site is mostly just HTMl and CSS for now.
    I wanna turn this blog post into an induviual webpage.
    I've been learning alot of this code from <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/default.asp"; target="_blank">W3Schools.com.</a>
    this isn't my first progaming venture. I currently know Python, C++, and a bit of bash.
    You can find some of my programs at my <a href="https://github.com/erikresendiz/Code" target="_blank">github repo. </a>
    It's nothing exactly ground breaking, their my first programs that I've made while learning.
    I'm a really big fan of the open source community, huge fan of GNU/Linux I currently run Manjaro.
    I'm gonna keep adding to this website as I learn more till next time!
